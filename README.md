# Burglar-Alarm


My Arduino UNO based project on small device which automatically sounds when someone stands near it. It means it sounds loud when it detects someone near it. It detects object in a range of 15cm. When someone go into that range, it sounds in different combination of frequencies. We can program this diffrently based on the user's choice.
